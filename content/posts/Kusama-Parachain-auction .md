## Why is it important to support Robonomics in the Kusama slots auction?

</section>

The main goal of Robonomics is to connect IoT devices using the Polkadot network. For example, it allows Polkadot users to [pay vending machines or robots in any token of the Polkadot ecosystem](https://robonomics.network/blog/robobank-introduction/).

Robonomics is a project with a long history that started in 2015, after the launch of the Ethereum network. During the projectâ€™s development, the team published more than [10 academic articles](https://robonomics.network/community#science) and created more than [15 R&D projects](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/r-and-d-based-on-robonomics-network/) which included control of drones, industrial manipulators, sensor networks, and even a Boston Dynamicsâ€™ robot dog over Ethereum and Polkadot networks.

Robonomics is a project that integrates new technologies into the real economy. However, to fuel this, a reasonable â€˜gasâ€™ price is required. Kusama makes the costs of communication between IoT devices and humans affordable.
